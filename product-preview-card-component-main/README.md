## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the front end web project I completed on my own using a mobile-first workflow. Like many other beginners, I was skeptical and hesitant to adopt this method at first, but now I understand why most professionals develop this way.

I learned how to change the source of an image depending on screen size using only HTML.

While I already knew how to use Flexbox properties to an extent, this project really helped me gain a visceral understanding of it.

### Continued development

I'm really going to focus on using a mobile-first workflow. Once I had my mobile layout completed, altering the page for desktop using media queries was quite easy and very straight forward.

I'm also going to focus on establishing a more focused and efficient workflow for layout and design projects. I was a little too all-over-the-place for my liking with this project.

### Useful resources

- [Changing image src depending on screen size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30460681/changing-image-src-depending-on-screen-size) - This helped me learn how to select different images for different breakpoints. I tried a number of times (unsuccessfully) trying to define CSS background images before I found this.
